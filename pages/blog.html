            <h2>Why SWE?</h2>
            <h5>Yes I am, <span>Economics student</span></h5>
            <p>However, on third year of my study, I understood that I don't have any passion to work in this field.
                I had CSCI 115 course on my first year and I liked it, so I started to search how can I become IT person.
                I found out courses on <a href="openacademy.io" style="color: red">openacademy</a>. It was about Ruby and I wrote my first codes
                there. I liked Ruby but online studying didn't fit me well, so I wanted to find out something offline. There
                I found about alem. As it is mentioned on home page, alem is offline school without teachers and homeworks, also
                it is free. There students teach eachother and it is called peer-to-peer education. I am on my way to complete
                golang course and doing well there. For me back-end coding is more easier because it requires less creativness.
                So, for now my aim is to complete some projects on GO and find out my first job.

            <h2>How to Start?</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of courses which are online and offline. If you are NU student majoring not in Math, CS or Engineering, I would recommend you to try to register for CSCI 151
                or at least CSCI 115. There you will start your first coding languages, depending on course it can be C++ or Python. Also, I would recommend you to watch out free Harvard Course
                CS50. It will be enough to start your journey, however you should be prepared that it will be tough and requires a lot of effort. I study programming from 4 to 6 hours per day, if
                it is not weekend. So, combining with University, it is very very very hard...
