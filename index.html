                <p>alem is the first programming school in Central Asia based on the principles of mutual learning.

                    There are no teachers and boring lectures at alem, instead, learning is built on projects and the interaction of talented students with each other.

                <div class="photo"><img src="./images/nu.jpg" alt=""></div>
                <p>I am student of this University from 2018 and now on my way to finish it with major in Economics. During my studies, I have completed enough
                    math courses to be given math-intensive diploma. Also, I had learn macro- and microeconomics, econometrics, statistics and other related stuff.
                    However, I lost the passion that I had and now want to be software engineer in Big Tech company!

                <p>I am so called mezun(graduate) of Pavlodar Kazakh-Turkish Lyceum. I think it
                    was my best choice in live because I found not only one of best schools in terms
                    of education but also family. There everyone were my brothers and till this day I have only good
                    memories about my school.
